The current Java version of the code is not specified, as it does not contain any version-specific language features or syntax. 

However, to upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17 and incorporate any possible new language features, standards, and best practices, here is the modified code:

```java
package com.example.department.repository;

import com.example.department.entity.Department;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface DepartmentRepo extends JpaRepository<Department, Integer> {

    Department findByDid(int did);
}
```

Please note that the modifications made are minimal and mainly focused on following Java coding conventions, such as using camel case for package names (`repository` instead of `Repository`) and class names (`DepartmentRepo` instead of `DepartmentRepo`). Additionally, the code should adhere to the proper import statements and package structure.

Since the original code did not contain any Java version-dependent language features, there are no specific changes related to Java 17.
