The provided code appears to be a configuration file related to a Java Spring project, specifically for setting up the database connection using MySQL and configuring the Eureka server.

However, this code is not a Java code but rather a configuration file in the properties format. Therefore, there is no specific Java version associated with it.

To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, you don't need to modify the provided code as it is not Java code. However, if you have Java code that interacts with this configuration, you should ensure that the Java code is compatible with Java 17.

Note: Java compatibility is for the Java source code (.java files) and not for configuration files or property files.

If you have Java code that interacts with this configuration, please provide the Java code with the modifications you would like to make so I can assist you further.
