The given Java code is written in Java 8. 

Here's the modified code compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.example.department;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class DepartmentApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DepartmentApplication.class, args);
    }

}
```

No changes were required to the code as it is already compatible with Java 17. This is because the original code utilizes standard Java syntax and does not rely on any deprecated or removed features.
